BloodBound is basically a service that allows medical institutions like hospitals, clinics, and NGOs to connect directly with potential blood donors. It also allows individual users to post requests for urgent blood donation needs. Institutions and individual users are mannually verified and authorized by the admin and moderators.

The website was available on Netlify (with Heroku hosting the backend) at `bloodbound.netlify.app`. Since this was a non-commercial project and Heroku adopted a pay-wall strategy a few months after project completion, we've taken the project offline. You can see video demos of the website and the mobile port from the `Video Demo` folder. The mobile port's APK file has also been provided, but you can't login to access functionality with it since it relies on the same backend as the website.

I was responsible for the frontend on this project. The backend was handled by `https://github.com/methnoob`.
