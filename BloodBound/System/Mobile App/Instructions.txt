After installing node modules:

	Go to node modules/expo/AppEntry.js.
	Replace App with index in this file.
  
To run:

	Enable USB debugging on phone.
	npm start on backend and mobile frontend.
	Switch to tunnel on the localhost page.
	run 'adb reverse tcp:5000 tcp:5000' in a terminal (allows the phone to work with the laptop's localhost urls). Better to do this in a separate terminal, in case you get a Network Error due to the phone disconnecting or whatever.
